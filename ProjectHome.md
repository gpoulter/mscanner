[MScanner](http://mscanner.stanford.edu) retrieves Medline abstracts using machine learning.   The input is a list of PubMed IDs of articles on some topic, and the output is a page of articles most relevant to the topic as inferred from the examples.  The application was written during my [Masters Thesis](https://sites.google.com/site/grahampoulter/m-sc-thesis) on _Rapid statistical classification on the Medline database of biomedical literature._

  * The service is hosted at http://mscanner.stanford.edu
  * The issue tracker is on [Trello](https://trello.com/board/mscanner-board/4f0d30714ac4a64f673a2dda)
