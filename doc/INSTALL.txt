MScanner: Extend a set citations
================================

:Author: Graham Poulter
                                     

MScanner takes a set of articles from MEDLINE, and trains a
classifier to search MEDLINE for other articles similar that set.  

Installation
============

Unzip the program, which extracts to the subdirectory ``mscanner``,
and install all the dependencies

Dependencies
============

`Python <http://www.python.org>`_
 The Python programming language, version 2.4 or greater.

`PyRXP <http://www.reportlab.org/pyrxp.html>`_
 Extremely fast XML parser (one call to the RXP library, implemented
 in C), used for parsing Medline citations from XML.  On Windows,
 download the DLLs; on posix systems compile from source.

`path module <http://www.jorendorff.com/articles/python/path/>`_
 The Python "path" module provides convenient path manipulation
 functions. Used everywhere.

`Gnuplot-py <http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/>`_
 Gnuplot-py is used for plotting the graphs output during
 validation. It in turn requires `Gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_
 to be installed.

`PySQLite <http://pysqlite.org/>`_ or `cx_Oracle <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-oracle/>`_
 These packages are supported for exporting results to a database.  If
 you don't install one of them, you can export as SQL text, or just
 use the flat-file output that is produced by default.  PySQLite is
 included in Python 2.5 and later.

`Epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_
 Generates API documentation for MScanner.

`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
 When available we use the SciPy stats.kde module to perform Kernel
 Density Estimation (KDE) and draw a probability density function
 instead of a histogram during validation. SciPy in turn requires
 NumPy as well as ATLAS or LAPACK and BLAS.  No worries on Windows,
 and Linux distributions should install the dependencies automagically.

Input Data
==========

You will need to obtain the following data:

Medline Citation Database
 A directory containing .xml.gz files of Medline citation records.
 Medline can be obtained by signing and faxing a memorandum of
 understanding with the NLM and downloading via FTP.

A list of PubMed IDs to query with
 A text file with one PubMed ID per line.  The classifier is trained
 with the query articles to retrieve new articles that are most
 similar to the query as a whole.

Table of drug names
 Only necessary for gene-drug association.  This can be obtained from
 a PharmGKB developter.  Look in ``HOME/utils/drugtable.py`` for the
 format of the table, which is converted to a Python pickle file which
 MScanner can use.

MeSH Term Exclusion Files
 Download MeSH from the NLM, and use ``HOME/utils/meshexcludes.py`` to
 generate Python pickles containing terms to exclude during parsing.
 The purpose is to reduce the size of the database by excluding
 non-informative MeSH terms.
