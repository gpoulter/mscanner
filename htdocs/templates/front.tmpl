<p>Maintaining a comprehensive database of the literature on a particular
subject is a difficult task, even using tools based on keyword searching.
MScanner instead trains a probablistic classifier from a set of example
citations (referenced by PubMed IDs). The output includes a ranked list of
PubMed IDs and scores, and a page of abstracts for the results. Mscanner can be
used for updating database literature annotations or to extend or update sets
of related articles such as text mining corpora or individual's collections of
subject-specific articles.</p>

<p>MScanner aggregates the journal and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms of
all of the example citations and uses a Naive Bayes classifier to locate
citations which have the most similar distribution of features to the examples.
Medline citations have 15 features on average. Since random inputs, or other
poorly coherent sets of examples, yield poor performance we have implemented
cross validated performance statistics including distributions of feature and
article scores, precision versus recall curves, and a graph which shows how the
score cutoff was chosen. MScanner achieves areas under the ROC curves of
approximately 0.98 to 0.99 using a variety of test data sets, which is
excellent for many purposes. </p>
