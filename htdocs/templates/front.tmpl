<p class="narrow">MScanner is a medline classifier, which
learns a model of the topic being searched for from examples of relevant
citations (the more examples the better).  While it is easy to 
find a few relevant results in the output of PubMed, in situations where
you need hundreds of citations on a particular topic MScanner is here
to make use of any existing examples.</p>
