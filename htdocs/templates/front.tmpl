<p>Please see the <a href="static/thesis.pdf">masters thesis</a> for 
detailed information about the classifier.  The background chapter also
provides a readable introduction to text classification.</a>

<p>To use the service, just paste a list of <em>PubMed IDs</em>
into the input box on the <a href="query">submit a task</a>  page.  There is a <q>Help</q> button for each of the 
advanced options, but the defaults should be fine.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=PubMed">PubMed</a> is
a search engine for Medline.  This is a classifier, which learns
what a topic looks like from the examples provided, to 
distinguish relevant Medline records from irrelevant ones.  This
is useful for curating biomedical databases (where hundreds of
examples are available, having been used to curate database entries), and
also to expand collections of citations.</p>

<p>The more examples the better. In fact, using only one example will often 
return zero results: it specifies a very narrow topic, and it is unlikely 
for anything in Medline to share enough features with the example to have a positive
score.  We recommend using the Related Articles feature found on 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=PubMed">PubMed</a> 
if you have just one
example: it finds the most similar records in PubMed.  You may
however set the score threshold down to -500 instead of zero to return
even the negative-scoring results from the classifier.</p>

<p>After clicking <q>submit</q> you will be taken to
the <a
href="status">status</a> page to monitor the progress of the task, until a
link to the results appears on the <a href="output">output</a> page.  Filtering
Medline takes roughly 90 seconds when using MeSH terms, and about 3 minutes
if title/abstract words are included.  At the bottom of the page,
you can see results for the filtering and cross validation runs
in the MScanner publication.  To evaluate MScanner's performance using
cross validation, you will need at least 30 PubMed IDs (see results on
sample topics below).</p>
